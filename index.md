# About Me:
- I am currently 13 years of age
- I am in 8th grad
- I am a Life Scout in Boy Scouts
- I love to code and read
- I built my own computer in June of 2020
- I have worked on many projects such as a [discord writer bot](https://github.com/cwarwicker/discord-Writer-Bot) and even [my own programming language](https://github.com/marvelman3284/basic-lang)

## Projects and langauges:
# Langauges:
I currently know:
1. Python (Fluent)
2. Javascript (Mostly Fluent)
3. HTML (Know enough for my needs)
4. C# (Know enough for my needs)
5. Kotlin (Still Learning)
6. Java (Still Learning)

# Projects:
- [Discord writer bot](https://github.com/cwarwicker/discord-Writer-Bot):
   - I have worked on an contributed to this, but my work is mostly done for this project.
- [My own programming language](https://github.com/marvelman3284/basic-lang):
   - This is an interpreter for the BASIC language at it's core, but once I finish it it will be a new language known as RAJ (Real-Time, Analog, Java). By no means is my langauge a copy of JAVA, it's just a random acronym that sounds tech-ish! And for those who knew my father know that he never made sense either!
- [Pong in Python](https://github.com/marvelman3284/Pong-):
   - The real reason for this one is I needed to create a game for my Game Design Merit Badge.
- [My 7th Grade Science Project](https://github.com/marvelman3284/Sci-Project):
   - Here I have a few ideas of what I was gonna do for my project. We ended up simulating Conways Game of Life using the python module Turtle.
- [A discord bot that contains a leveling system](https://github.com/marvelman3284/stat-bot):
   - This is one of my many discord bots that I have created. The leveling feature is the only feature in the bot but when it was being used it only needed a leveling system.
- [A more fleshed out discord bot](https://github.com/marvelman3284/The-List-Bot):
   - This is what we called *The List Bot* it was made for a discord server that had a large focus around lists ergo the name. It is one of my better project with it being fleshed out and very functional.
